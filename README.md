## How to Use and Build

It’s simple!  
1. Install the latest version of the PS3 SDK, ProDG, and Visual Studio 2013 Pro on your PC.  
2. I recommend having at least 8GB of RAM and 15GB of available storage.  
3. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio and press **Build**.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please don't bother me. If you know how to create a SPRX, go ahead and do it yourself. If not, don’t attempt it.
